# Extract Smooth Feature Lines from Surface Mesh

This is a python implementation of [smooth feature line on surface mesh](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-geom/publications/db/feature.pdf).

## Tasks
     1. Compute discrete extremality coefficients
     2. Smooth them
     3. Trace feature lines in regular triangles
     4. Process singular triangles
     5. Remove small ridges by a threshold filter (refering to [Ridge-valley lines on meshes via implicit surface fitting](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015706.1015768)
